# Traveling-Salesman-Problem-with-Jgrapht-and-Genetic-Algorithm
The Traveling Salesman Problem was solved with Jgrapht, which is a free library for graph visualisation in Java. 
The second solition was done through a simple genetic algorithm which uses the principles of problems based on
natural selection process that mimics biological evolution.
